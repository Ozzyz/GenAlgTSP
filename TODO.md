## TODO:
- Observe results (speed of convergence, ..?) of tweaking different parameters (population size, crossover/mutation percentage, ..?)
- Implement a stopping criterion that avoids that rather useless iterations (generations) are com-
puted.
- Implement and use another representation and appropriate crossover and mutation operators.
Perform some parameter tuning to identify proper combinations of the parameters.
- Implement local optimization
- Compare solution to benchmark problems
- Implement and use two other parent selection methods, i.e. fitness proportional selection
and tournament selection. Compare the results with those obtained using the default rank-
based selection.
- Implement one survivor selection strategy (besides the already implemented elitism). Per-
form experiments and evaluate the results.
- Implement and use one of the techniques aimed at preserving population diversity (e.g.
subpopulations/islands, crowding, . . . ). Perform experiments and evaluate the results.
- Incorporate an adaptive or self-adaptive parameter control strategy (e.g. parameters that
depend on the state of the population, parameters that co-evolve with the population, . . . ).
Perform experiments and evaluate the results.
